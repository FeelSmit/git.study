Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks though they are here to stay
And I believe in yesterday

Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
There is a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday
